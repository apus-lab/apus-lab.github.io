See <a href="https://github.com/apus-lab/dymad">Code</a> and <a href="https://dymad.readthedocs.io/">Documentation</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Feel free to try it out, give feedback, and/or contribute!</strong></p>

<p>DyMAD aims to provide a lightweight and user-friendly toolkit for modeling and analyzing dynamical systems using data-driven approaches.</p>

<p>Currently, we have implemented the following features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Data preprocessing pipeline specialized for time series data.</li>
  <li>Models for different types of dynamical systems, including
    <ul>
      <li>Latent Dynamics Models</li>
      <li>Koopman Bilinear Forms</li>
      <li>The graph version of the above</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Training utilities, including
    <ul>
      <li>Neural-ODE-based optimizer</li>
      <li>Weak-form optimizer</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Miscellaneous utilities, including
    <ul>
      <li>Samplers for inputs and initial conditions</li>
      <li>Visualization tools</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The implemented and planned algorithms and features for DyMAD are mainly based on the <a href="/publications/">research work</a> from our lab.  The lead developer is Dr. Yin Yu, whose PhD thesis is on the topic of data-driven modeling of dynamical systems on graphs.</p>

<p>It is still far from complete, see our <a href="https://dymad.readthedocs.io/en/latest/roadmap.html">Roadmap</a> for more details.</p>]]></content><author><name>Daning Huang</name></author><category term="news" /><category term="research" /><category term="Publication" /><category term="Software" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have published the first software package from our lab, DyMAD.

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.22890">Our recent work</a> is a milestone of such effort.  We developed a systematic reduced-order modeling methodology that integrates the coarse-graining theory from statistical mechanics and numerical methods from machine learning community.  The end product is the <strong>physics-infused reduced-order modeling</strong> (PIROM), that is simultaneously <strong>accurate</strong>, <strong>computationally efficient</strong>, and <strong>extrapolates to unseen scenarios</strong>.  In conventional modeling, achieving any of the two sacrifices the third.</p>

<p>We demonstrated the methodology on a high-speed thermal protection system, governed by a parameterized nonlinear parabolic PDE.  While the PIROM is trained using only one set of material properties, it achieves <strong>zero-shot learning</strong> and extrapolates with ease to completely new material properties without any new samples.</p>

<p>The work is done jointly with collaborators from the Sandia National Lab, Drs. Patrick Blonigan and John Tencer.</p>

Only 3.3% papers of the nearly 11500 submissions are selected as Spotlight.</p>

<p>In this work, we address the problem of learning ordinary differential equations (ODEs) on manifolds by devising (1) an <strong>operator-valued kernel</strong> to represent vector fields on manifolds and (2) a <strong>geometry-preserving time integrator</strong> that enforces the ODE solution to lie a manifold.  The algorithm is rooted in theories of differential goemetry and dynamical systems, with <strong>rigorous convergence bounds</strong>.  We verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach on high-dimensional dynamical systems, including the cavity flow problem, the beating and travelling waves in Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equations, and the reaction-diffusion dynamics.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: This talk addresses the challenges in designing the next-generation engineering systems — think high-speed aircraft and autonomous vehicles — which require a control co-design approach that considers dynamical and control performance at an early design stage.  In this case, the co-design suffers from a computational bottleneck, denoted as the <strong>Impossible Trinity of Modeling</strong>.  This means, for a dynamical model, satisfying any two sacrifices the third: high fidelity, computational efficiency, and design parametrization.</p>

<p>We present our recent efforts in resolving the bottleneck via the <strong>Geometry-Informed Reduced-Order Modeling</strong>.  In simple terms, we use known physical laws and the inherent topology of the system dynamics to build data-driven models that turn the Impossible Trinity to a possible one.  This methodology potentially opens up the path towards integrated multi-disciplinary optimization of complex dynamical systems.</p>]]></content><author><name>Daning Huang</name></author><category term="news" /><category term="Seminar" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Mar. 20th, Dr. Huang delivered a seminar in the department, since his last seminar in 2019.

<ul>
  <li>Parker Smith, Subarna Pudasaini, and Daning Huang</li>
  <li>This is an on-going work supported by our <a href="/award_career/">NSF CAREER Award</a>.  In this paper, we attempted to <strong>formulate a control co-design problem</strong> while bypassing the expensive solves of trajectory optimization sub-problems.  In an initial demonstration, the new formulation is extremely fast to solve and the results align with physical intuition.</li>

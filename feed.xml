<p>The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is demonstrated through two case studies: a 2D academic example and a panel flutter problem.

Furthermore, parameterized isostable and isochron identified by EKBF provides valuable insights into the nonlinear flutter system.</p>

<p>In this work, we address the problem of learning ordinary differential equations (ODEs) on manifolds by devising (1) an <strong>operator-valued kernel</strong> to represent vector fields on manifolds and (2) a <strong>geometry-preserving time integrator</strong> that enforces the ODE solution to lie a manifold.  The algorithm is rooted in theories of differential goemetry and dynamical systems, with <strong>rigorous convergence bounds</strong>.  We verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach on high-dimensional dynamical systems, including the cavity flow problem, the beating and travelling waves in Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equations, and the reaction-diffusion dynamics.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: This talk addresses the challenges in designing the next-generation engineering systems — think high-speed aircraft and autonomous vehicles — which require a control co-design approach that considers dynamical and control performance at an early design stage.  In this case, the co-design suffers from a computational bottleneck, denoted as the <strong>Impossible Trinity of Modeling</strong>.  This means, for a dynamical model, satisfying any two sacrifices the third: high fidelity, computational efficiency, and design parametrization.</p>

<p>We present our recent efforts in resolving the bottleneck via the <strong>Geometry-Informed Reduced-Order Modeling</strong>.  In simple terms, we use known physical laws and the inherent topology of the system dynamics to build data-driven models that turn the Impossible Trinity to a possible one.  This methodology potentially opens up the path towards integrated multi-disciplinary optimization of complex dynamical systems.</p>]]></content><author><name>Daning Huang</name></author><category term="news" /><category term="Seminar" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Mar. 20th, Dr. Huang delivered a seminar in the department, since his last seminar in 2019.

<p>At the 2025 SIAM Conference on Computational Science and Engineering, we contributed two talks with our collaborators. Here are the summaries:</p>

<p>At the AIAA SciTech 2025 conference, we contributed three papers over a range of research fields, with our collaborators. Here are the summaries:</p>

<p><a href="https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.2025-1017">A Parametric Study for the Effect of Morphing on Aerial Vehicles in Obstacle Avoidance</a></p>
<ul>
  <li>Parker Smith and Daning Huang</li>
  <li>Though preliminary, this is the first research product from our recent <a href="/award_career/">NSF CAREER Award</a>.  In this paper, we studied the <strong>effects of morphing</strong> of an aerial vehicle in the scenarios of reachability and obstacle avoidance.  It was found that considering morphing in an aerial vehicle via a global coordination over the entire flight mission (via trajectory optimization) can release the full potential of morphing, and enable <strong>drastically enhanced maneuverability</strong> when compared to the fixed-wing counterpart.</li>

</ul>

<p><a href="https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.2025-0423">Global Description of Flutter Dynamics via Koopman Theory</a></p>
<ul>
  <li>Jiwoo Song and Daning Huang</li>
  <li>As a continuation from <a href="/news_st24/">last year’s work</a>, we developed a rigorous framework for <strong>globally linearizing</strong> nonlinear flutter dynamics using a <strong>General Koopman Bilinear Form</strong>, and show that using partial measurements of pre-flutter dynamics one can construct a dynamical model to <strong>predict the onset of flutter</strong>.  Demonstrated on a high-speed panel flutter problem.</li>

<p><a href="https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.2025-1134">Reduced-Order Modeling of Resolved Turbulent Flows for High-Speed Fluid-Structure Interaction Analysis</a></p>
<ul>
  <li>Elliot Kimmel, Daning Huang, Vansh Sharma, Jagmohan Singh, <a href="https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/apcl/home">Venkatramanan Raman</a>, <a href="https://aero.engin.umich.edu/people/friedmann-peretz-p/">Peretz P. Friedmann</a></li>
  <li>This is a major <strong>collaborative effort</strong> between Penn State and UMich.  We focus on the <strong>shock wave/boundary layer interaction</strong> over a compression ramp in hypersonic flow, and this time we developed <strong>reduced-order model</strong> method capable of generating resolved turbulent boundary layer pressure fluctuation loads at a reduced computational cost for aeroelastic analysis.</li>

<p>Lastly, Dr. Huang was able to contribute to the Education Outreach event organized by the AIAA Structural Dynamics TC at the Walker Middle School.

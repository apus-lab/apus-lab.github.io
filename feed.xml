Dr. Renganathan is an expert in Bayesian decision theory.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>  Modern day engineering decision-making involves one or more computer simulation oracles of an engineered system which can be queried on-demand to learn the system response to control input. Querying simulation oracles, also called “computer experiments”, incur a non-trivial computational cost, which increases with the level of fidelity in the underlying models. For instance, a realistic computational aerodynamic simulation of an aircraft can cost several thousands of CPU hours to compute—anything more than a few dozens of such simulations is prohibitive. Therefore, a central goal of engineering decision-making is to optimally design computer experiments, to maximize the value of information extracted at minimal computational effort.</p>

<p>In this talk, we will address problems anchored in the decision-making triad namely: experiment design, uncertainty quantification, and numerical optimization. Specifically, using variants of Gaussian process surrogate models and a Bayesian decision theoretic framework, we will show that problems in the decision-making triad can be solved in a principled, theoretically sound and, yet, (computational) cost-effective manner. We will show demonstrations on applications in computational aerodynamics.</p>]]></content><author><name>Daning Huang</name></author><category term="news" /><category term="Seminar" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[We hosted Dr. Ashwin Renganathan from AERSP/ICDS of PSU for a CAV talk via the AI/ML technical group.

Downscaling is a technique to overcome the dilemma by fusing spatiotemporal data of different resolutions.  Downscaling has been done for spatially continuous datasets, such as climate simulation data, but it remains a challenge to fuse unstructured distributed data, such as weather station measurements.</p>

<p>In our <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212095524001998">recent work</a>, we tackle the downscaling involving a mixture of structured and unstructured data via a <strong>graph neural network</strong> (GNN) framework, and applied the framework to a street-level temperature estimation problem.  Furthermore, we conducted in-depth analysis of feature importance to enhance the <strong>model interpretability</strong>; sensitivity of features are shown in figure below.  Our findings highlight GNN’s high potential in capturing the complex dynamics between urban elements and their impacts on microclimate, thus offering valuable insights for comprehensive urban data collection and urban climate modeling in general.</p>

<p>To elucidate when and how such approach works, in our recent <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09324.pdf">ArXiv</a> manuscript, we systematically developed <strong>coarse-grained reduced-order models</strong> for networked dynamical systems.  Using the <strong>Mori-Zwanzig</strong> formalism, we quantify the impact of coarse-graining on the strength and distribution of interactions, and the required TDE length; subsequently we use this knowledge to rigorously design GNN architectures accordingly.  The approach is demonstrated on an academic Kuramoto example and a realistic power grid problem.</p>

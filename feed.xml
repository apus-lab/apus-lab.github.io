<h2 id="operator-theoretic-methods-for-reduced-order-modeling">Operator-Theoretic Methods for Reduced-Order Modeling</h2>

<p>Dr. Huang and <a href="https://research.cec.sc.edu/wang">Dr. Yi Wang</a> co-organized a special session “Operator-Theoretic Methods for Reduced-Order Modeling in Structural Dynamics and Aeroelasticity” that focuses on the application of Koopman theory to nonlinear structural dynamics and aeroelasticity.  In this session, we contributed two papers:</p>

<p><a href="https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/10.2514/6.2024-2266">Parametrized Global Linearization Models for Flutter Prediction</a></p>
<ul>
  <li>Jiwoo Song, Yin Yu, Daning Huang</li>
  <li>We provided an initial development of a rigorous framework for <strong>globally linearizing</strong> nonlinear flutter dynamics using the so-called <strong>Koopman Bilinear Form</strong>, and show that using partial measurements of pre-flutter dynamics one can construct a dynamical model, bilinear in system parameter, to <strong>predict the onset of flutter</strong>.  Demonstrated on a high-speed panel flutter problem.</li>

<ul>
  <li>Jacob C. Rains, Daning Huang, <a href="https://research.cec.sc.edu/wang">Yi Wang</a></li>
  <li>In parallel to the parametric model above, we also explore <strong>flutter dynamics with bilinear inputs</strong>, aiming to produce a unified, relatively simple yet accurate model for the <strong>flutter suppression</strong> in a wide range of flow conditions.</li>

<ul>
  <li>Carlos Vargas Venegas, Daning Huang</li>
  <li>We continue to work on the PIROM, in an attempt to resolve the <a href="/rsch_pirom/"><strong>Impossible Trinity of Modeling</strong></a>.  The PIROM requires learning a differential equation from data, which can pose numerical challenge in training.  We proposed and demonstrated a weak-form formulation for <strong>accelerated learning</strong> of such models.</li>

<ul>
  <li>Aravinth Sadagopan, Daning Huang</li>
  <li>This is the sequel to our work on the high-fidelity analysis of the CSR geometry in hypersonic flow.  This time we reveal the key physical mechanism for shear layer oscillation, via linear stability analysis, that is the main driving force of FTSI in the case that we consider.</li>

  <li>This is a major <strong>collaborative effort</strong> between Penn State and UMich.  We focus on the <strong>shock wave/boundary layer interaction</strong> over a compression ramp in hypersonic flow, and explore the key physics that may impact the structural response during the FTSI.  In short, in the case that we explored, <strong>not necessarily all</strong> complex flow features, esp. the turbulence, impact the structure.</li>

<p><a href="https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/10.2514/6.2024-2484">A Convex Approach to High-fidelity Landing Trajectory Optimization for Advanced Air Mobility</a></p>
<ul>
  <li>Yufei Wu, Sabrullah Deniz, <a href="http://volweb.utk.edu/~zwang124">Zhenbo Wang</a>, Daning Huang</li>
  <li>With our collaborators from U. of Tennessee, Knoxville, we continued the previous studies that couple <strong>higher-fidelity ODE-based aerodynamic models</strong> into trajectory optimization during landing.  We develop a <strong>convexification technique</strong> to make the more complex optimization, with the ODE aero model, possible, producing more realistic trajectories for landing.  This could be leveraged for real-time deployment for <strong>safer landing</strong>.</li>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>  The talk gives a high-level overview of several projects underway at the Interdisciplinary Scientific Computing Laboratory (ISCL) at Pennsylvania State University. ISCL is housed in the School of Information Science and Technology and performs research in scientific machine learning (SciML) with applications to various domain sciences. Our research program sits at the intersection of machine learning, high-performance computing, and computational science and engineering while being motivated by grand challenge problems in different domains. Some of the research areas investigated in ISCL include novel methods for physics-informed surrogate modeling, multimodal data and model fusion, interpretable machine learning for scientific computing, and scientific reinforcement learning for controlling simulations. Furthermore, ISCL is also devoted to the development of scalable and reproducible methods for machine learning that may interface with legacy computing workflows. The presented talk will be free-form and interactive, with the speaker taking requests from the audience for deep-dives into specific research themes to enable future collaborations.</p>]]></content><author><name>Daning Huang</name></author><category term="news" /><category term="Seminar" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[We hosted Dr. Romit Maulik from IST/ICDS of PSU for a CAV talk via the AI/ML technical group.

Dr. He’s expertise lies in the high-fidelity optimization of multi-disciplinary dynamical systems.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong> Multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) has been widely used in the aerospace industry. Problems with millions of state variables and hundreds of design variables are solved. However, from the perspective of dynamical systems, most of the previous research focused on equilibrium point problems. To enable MDO for general dynamical systems, we develop efficient computation methods based on Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov (JFNK), algorithmic differentiation (AD), and adjoint methods. Applications in wind turbine design and aeroelastic limit cycle oscillation (LCO) (or flutter) suppression are discussed. Besides, control co-design (CCD) is an emerging field that aims to incorporate optimal control as one discipline into MDO to substitute the traditional sequential design workflow used in the industry. CCD is a powerful idea that can exploit the complex interaction between the plant and the control variables. However, most of the previous research focused on low-fidelity models. To enable CCD for high-fidelity models, we propose an efficient sensitivity computation method based on the coupled adjoint method. A quadrotor blade CCD problem is presented where the control cost is reduced by about 50% from a sequentially optimized design. Finally, we discuss the data-driven method in aerodynamic shape optimization. Using our neural network model, we can conduct real-time airfoil shape optimization with accurate lift, drag, and moment coefficients (&lt;1% relative error) for both subsonic and transonic regimes.</p>]]></content><author><name>Daning Huang</name></author><category term="news" /><category term="Seminar" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[We hosted Dr. Sicheng He from University of Tennessee, Knoxville, for a seminar in our department.

<p>In a nutshell, PyPose enables the <strong>full-stack, end-to-end differentiable learning</strong> for robotic applications.  One key challenge in robotic learning is the effective representation of poses, i.e., orientations and positions of robots, that requires the usage of Lie group; PyPose is a unique library that bakes Lie group into PyTorch in the robotic context.  In this effort, in collaboration with Dr. Geng, we contributed functionalities and applications on the control and system side.</p>

  <li>This paper aims to address one main challenge in the <strong>energy management of electrified aircraft</strong> involving nonlinear electro-thermo-mechanical dynamics.  Hierarchical control is a potent method to control the system in an efficient and nearly optimal manner, yet it requires the knowledge of <strong>multiple timescales</strong> that are unlikely available.</li>
  <li>We developed an algorithm that leverages Koopman theory for <strong>systematic timescale decomposition</strong> of a networked dynamical system, which informs the design of a hierarchical control framework.  The whole workflow is demonstrated on an electrified unmanned aerial vehicle.</li>

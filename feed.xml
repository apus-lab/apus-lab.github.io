<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.17203">Our recent work</a> superceeds the method using a surprisingly simpler formulation, while extending even to chaotic dynamics, where the states no longer lie on nice smooth objects such as manifolds, but fractal-dimensional strange attractors.</p>

<p>Across a broad range of systems, including smooth manifolds, chaotic attractors, and high-dimensional spatiotemporal flows, the new method, DM-KRR, consistently outperforms stateof-the-art random feature, neural-network and operator-learning methods in both accuracy and data efficiency. These findings underscore that long-term predictive skill depends not only on model expressiveness, but critically on respecting the geometric constraints encoded in the data through dynamically consistent model selection. Together, simplicity, geometry awareness, and strong empirical performance point to a promising path for reliable and efficient learning of complex dynamical systems.</p>

<p>The goal of the project is to reveal geometric structures encoded in the measured time series of the dynamics, i.e., the data manifold, to enable compact reduced-order modeling for scalable numerical simulations.  Specifically, we will consider (1) learning dynamics on manifolds with provable preservation of geometrical constraints; (2) learning Lie symmetry groups of dynamics, that leads to scaling/similarity laws of complex dynamical systems.</p>

<p>The first aim generalizes our physics-infused reduced-order modeling (ROM) methodology from the <a href="/award_career/">NSF CAREER project</a> into a <strong>geometry-infused</strong> ROM.  The second aim is a leap from our prior work on aerothermoelastic scaling (brutal force in engineering) to a more systematic and elegant mathematical treatment via Lie group theory.</p>]]></content><author><name>Daning Huang</name></author><category term="news" /><category term="Funding" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are happy to announce the award of an NSF project from the Computational and Data-Enabled Science and Engineering (CDS&amp;E) program, titled Leveraging Geometric Structure in Learning Dynamical Systems.

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.22890">Our recent work</a> is a milestone of such effort.  We developed a systematic reduced-order modeling methodology that integrates the coarse-graining theory from statistical mechanics and numerical methods from machine learning community.  The end product is the <strong>physics-infused reduced-order modeling</strong> (PIROM), that is simultaneously <strong>accurate</strong>, <strong>computationally efficient</strong>, and <strong>extrapolates to unseen scenarios</strong>.  In conventional modeling, achieving any of the two sacrifices the third.</p>

<p>We demonstrated the methodology on a high-speed thermal protection system, governed by a parameterized nonlinear parabolic PDE.  While the PIROM is trained using only one set of material properties, it achieves <strong>zero-shot learning</strong> and extrapolates with ease to completely new material properties without any new samples.</p>

<p>The work is done jointly with collaborators from the Sandia National Lab, Drs. Patrick Blonigan and John Tencer.</p>

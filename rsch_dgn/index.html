    <p>Often a complex engineering system can be modeled as <strong>a system of subsystems</strong> that interact with each other and with the environment.  Leveraging the connectivity between the subsystems, i.e., the <strong>topology</strong>, can greatly reduce the efforts in the modeling, optimization, and control of such systems.
The geometric deep learning technique, esp., <strong>graph neural networks</strong> (GNNs), is an effective and powerful tool for the <strong>topology-informed modeling</strong> of complex systems, with a few unique features:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Training efficiency and scalability</strong>: The GNNs model localized interactions between the subsystems; thus can be trained on datasets of small systems and scale up to large inter-connected systems</li>
  <li><strong>Missing data completion</strong>: The GNNs reconstruct missing dynamical states by leveraging spatiotemporal correlations as well as time-delay embedding theorems in dynamical system theory</li>
</ul>

<p>Recently, we have been able to apply GNNs for various applications,
from the vanilla modeling of dynamics</p>
<ul>
  <li>Power grid dynamics (Figure left below, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08557">paper</a>, <a href="/award_amps_22/">fund</a>)</li>
  <li>Ship airwakes (Figure right below, <a href="https://doi.org/10.2514/6.2022-2533">paper</a>)</li>
  <li>Heatwave forecasting (<a href="/rsch_heat/">More details</a>, <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023GL103405">paper</a>)</li>
</ul>
